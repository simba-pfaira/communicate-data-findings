# Ford GoBike Data Exploration

## by Simba Pfaira

## Dataset

> This project explores the San Francisco Bay Area Bike Share dataset which contains information about trips taken by riders, their subscription type, their age, their gender, stations of starting and ending trips, duration of trips among other attributes.

> The San Francisco Bay Area Bike Share is a public bicycle sharing system around the San Francisco Bay Area. Bicycles are made available for shared use to individuals on a short term basis for a once-off price or for a monthly or annual subscription fees.

> The system allows people to borrow a bike from a dock and return it at another dock belonging to the same system. Docks are special bike racks that lock the bike, and only release it by computer control.

> The user enters payment information, and the computer unlocks a bike. The user returns the bike by placing it in the dock, which locks it in place. The system uses smartphone mapping apps which show nearby available bikes and open docks.

## Summary of Findings

In the exploration phase of the dataset I observed the following-:

- bike trips are mostly short, between 5 or 15 minutes long.
- most of the trips were done by the users between 20 and 40 years of age, long trips being taken by them as well and they was reduction of trip durations as age goes up.
- week days has the most trips with Thursday and Tuesday being the highest.
- most trips start at during the 8th hour in the morning and during the 5th hour in the afternoon, which infers that most users take the trips to go to work.
- customers use the bikes for longer periods than subscribers and the trips usually takes place on weekend.
- San Francisco Caltrain Station 2 and Market St are the two most common destinations.

## Key Insights for Presentation

> For the explanatory analysis, I will focus on the trip durations, user types and member gender.

> I will start with a bar chart visual with the distribution of trip count for each age group, followed by he distribution of trips over the days of the week. Then I will present a box plot depicting the relationship between user type and trip duration.

> Finally I will present a scatterplot showing the distribution of trips duration for each gender for each user type, for a sample of 2000 trips to avoid overcrowding of plot points.
